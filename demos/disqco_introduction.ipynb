    "This notebook introduces the new structure of DisQCO, a software tool for distributing quantum circuits across networks of quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributing quantum circuits across quantum networks requires circuits to be *partitioned*. A partitioned quantum circuit is a set of sub-circuits which interact only via entanglement and LOCC, allowing all cross-QPU interaction to be handled by the network. The quality of a partitioned quantum circuit is determined by the amount of entanglement required. *Good* partitioning requires minimal use of entanglement. There are various formulations for quantum circuit partitioning, DisQCO is based on a generalised graphical framework, which uses hypergraphs with both spatial and temporal extension, allowing us to model logical qubit connectivity and time-evolution in quantum circuits. Partitioning problems are typically NP-hard, so DisQCO employs tailored *multilevel partitioning*, powered by well-established heuristics, to achieve low cost partitioning of circuits.\n",

In ```disqco```, we work in a generalised gate set, which uses parameterised single-qubit and two-qubit gates to compress the circuit representation. The gate set consists of the $U(\\theta, \\phi, \\lambda)$ single-qubit rotation gate, and the $CP(\\theta)$ two-qubit controlled-phase gate. This allows us to compress many single-qubit gates together, and easily determine the compatibility for gate teleportation.
