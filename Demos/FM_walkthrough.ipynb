    "# Quantum Circuit Partitioning with FM Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a brief intro to the contents of the repository, showing a basic workflow for partitioning a quantum circuit across multiple QPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The partitioning has a number of phases, some of which can be modified or removed in a modular fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given a circuit and quantum network information by the user and we want to return a partitioned circuit which is compatible with the network, and minimal in terms of the required entanglement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically we have the phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Transpilation\n",
    "\n",
    "The circuit is transpiled into a particular gate set. We recommend the $[ U(\\theta, \\phi, \\lambda), CP(\\theta)]$ gateset, since , which is used by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Graph conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "The circuit is converted into a \"temporal graph\" representing qubit interactions over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Gate grouping (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Edges on the graph are merged into hyper-edges based on their compatibility for gate teleportation. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Coarsening (optional) \n",
    "\n",
    "The graph is coarsened into a graph which is smaller and easier to optimise.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Partitioning and refinment \n",
    "\n",
    "The graph is partitioned using the FM algorithm. If the graph has been coarsened, the partitioning is refined at each level until the original graph is recovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Circuit extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "A quantum circuit is extracted, containing all the new information for qubit and gate teleportation.\n"

If this is set to false, then we get a regular graph with state edges connecting qubit nodes at successive time steps, and state edges for each two-qubit gate. If group_gates is set to true, then a pass is applied which merges some of these gate edges into hyper-edges. This makes the graph structure a bit more complex, so avoid it for now. We can tackle that later.\n",

Assignment[t][q] indicates the partition qubit $q$ is assigned to at time $t$. This corresponds to node $(q,t)$. The initial assignment just maps qubits in a greedy fashion, squeezing qubits onto the first QPU until its full then moving to the next. The assignment at $t=0$ is then used for the full depth."
